          <p class="h4 m-y-axis-0 flex-center text-gray-light m-top-md">The demand for cyber security employees is increasing at more than 3 times the pace of the rest of the IT job market, and 12 times the pace of the general job market. Current cybersecurity staffing shortages number between 20,000 and 40,000. This personnel shortage will likely remain for years, or possibly even decades into the future.

It is safe to say that graduates with a Masterâ€™s degree in Cybersecurity will have a considerable amount of career opportunities for many years to come. As long as the Internet is around, the need for cybersecurity professionals will be as well. This type of job security provides a peace of mind that is more valuable than financial compensation alone.</p>
